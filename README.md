# Jira-Bulk-Import
This project provides a web-based tool to preprocess CSV files for bulk import into JIRA. It structures the data, calculates estimates, and ensures compatibility with JIRA's issue tracking format. The application is built using Flask and pandas, with a responsive UI powered by Bootstrap.
